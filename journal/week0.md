### AWS Console
I made sure to setup IAM user after creating my AWS account,using the IAM user account is considerd best practice.
My ROOT user account is only going to be used to make payments and close the account.

I also had to create an iamadmin user in my IAM user account, i had to attache my iamadmin user to a group named admin in which full accsess,
And previllages are assigned to them both 

### AWS Budget
